# Our training system

Following Basic Combat Training, newly graduated Privates are assigned to a squad, where they may discuss their Advanced Infantry Training (AIT) options with the Squad Leader. Depending on the slots that are open in the squad, soldiers may request to train with the Rifle, BAR, Machine Gun, Bazooka, etc. and be given personalized training with their AIT weapon.

Soldiers may qualify for three different Arms Qualification Badges (AQB) for their AIT weapon: The Marksman Badge, the Sharpshooter Badge, and the Expert Badge. Each badge has a unit-wide list of criteria. With a lot of practice, as well as tips from their squad leader or other veteran 29ers, soldiers can meet these criteria and be awarded the badges, which will be proudly displayed on their service coats and qualify them for official battle. In addition, soldiers may qualify for the Expert Infantry Badge, another requirement for official battle, which pertains to combat skills and communication.

To speed up the process of training and qualifying, the Infantry School holds classes periodically where soldiers in training can receive tips from experts and be tested for the badge criteria. After qualifying high enough, soldiers will have the opportunity to pass on their skills to newer members in training as well, through leadership and the Infantry School.
