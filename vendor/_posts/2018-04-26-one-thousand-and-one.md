This week marks the nine-hundredth recorded training platoon the 29th Infantry Division has trained and graduated. For years, nine hundred times and more, the Lighthouse Corps staff have ensured the possibility of recruitment, guiding and dealing with each applicant so that they too were able to become members and know what to do and when to do it. They have hired, trained, provided, and time and time again, made soldiers out of those wanting to enlist in the 29th: five days a week, every week.

Our very own Lt. Col. Wheatley had the following to say about BCT:

> When I think about Lighthouse, the first thing that comes to my mind is just how crazy it is that every member of the 29th has gone through our Basic Combat Training program. Our BCT is one factor that makes our unit what it has been in the past, what it is today, and helps instill the core principles of the 29th Infantry Division. Battalion Headquarters is proud of the entire staff, past and present, and the work they have put in over the last 900 Training Platoons and how well they have overcome the challenges of designing and operating BCT throughout six different games during the history of the 29th Infantry Division. Here's to 900 more, gentlemen, keep up the great work!

Former Chief of Lighthouse, CW2 Lauritsen, concurs:

> The number of people that have to work behind the scenes so that just a single recruit can enter the unit is incredible. From the enlistment liaisons who make background checks and make sure that our recruits are ready for training and feel at home to the tough love provided by our training staff once training has begun, in order to mold the recruits into model soldiers. All to make sure that we only let in those individuals suited to join our unit. It's truly great.
