						<p id="about_section_header">&nbsp; History of Our Unit &nbsp;</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">The 29th Infantry Division was activated on March 14, 2005 playing in both the The Trenches and Battle Grounds. The reputable 29th Infantry Division that stands before you today participates in the "realism" community of the Red Orchestra Modification, Darkest Hour: Normandy 1944, Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm, Arma 3, Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, and Squad.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">Prior to August of 2008, the 29th Infantry Division was a unit within the Half-Life Modification, Day of Defeat. When the 29th started out in Day of Defeat, there were roughly 17 members, and almost half of them were inactive. Today, the 29th ID has come to be the largest Realism Unit with almost 300 members. Through training and discipline we've gotten to where we stand today. With new members, returning members, and even veteran members from nearly 6 years ago, we continue growing stronger by the day.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">Basic Combat Training, or BCT, is one of the ways we accomplish training new unit members, Cadets, into respectable soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division. Our intricate and well organized office, Lighthouse, takes care of BCT and trains every soldier that enters the unit.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">Because of Lighthouse and its efforts, our number are constantly growing. There are many other offices and ways to get involved in the unit; here in the 29th we don't simply "get by." Hundreds of individuals have put forth hundreds of hours building the foundation on which this unit stands today, and we are proud to call ourselves soldiers of the Fightin' 29th!</p>

									</div>
									<div class="body">
										<p>Our journey started in 2005 in the game The Trenches and Battle Grouds as a small group setting the very first footprint in our path of history. It was founded by at the time Captain Pak. Later was taken over by Captain Radcliffe.</p>

										<h2><span class="small">MOVEMENT INTO DOD</span> GAME CHANGE</h2>
									</div>
									<div class="body">
										<p>We completely moved to Day of Defeat and closed down the prior two companies. We closed down the company in the prior two games and stuck in one game each time we changed. This is where most of our roots can be traced back too today and here is where major changes took place to put in place the regulations that are still abided by today. These changes were brought on by another Company HQ level change during a transition from Captain Radcliffe to Captain Wilson in late 2006. He would then bring in the one game rule.</p>

										<h2><span class="small">MOVE TO DARKEST HOUR</span> BATTALION LEVEL</h2>
									</div>
									<div class="body">
										<p>After DOD became dated we moved to the next hottest thing striving and alive as ever. We did another game change to darkest hour. We upgraded to Battalion size right away. We went from four platoons and one company into two platoons for two different comapnies each. So instead of just being a company we created a different company. We mainly utalized for for an eastern comapny and western company.</p>

										<h2><span class="small">SPLIT INTO ARMA 3 AND RO2/RS </span> MULTI GAMES</h2>
									</div>
									<div class="body">
										<p>As new games came out that would be adequate for our needs we started to check out our options. We learned that there was a demand for a a realism unit such as ourself in the games Arma 3 and RO2/RS. After the decission was made to break our one game tradition, we swiftly transitioned into creating two new companies for the game, which is where Charlie and Baker were formed. Baker was no longer associated with Darkest Hour. We stayed in DH and put all the platoons under one comapny thar was called Able. That would leave dog company unattended which left to it being disbanded and ressurected later. We solved the time zone issue by making platoons dedicated to eastern and western personnel.</p>

									</div>
									<div class="body">
										<p>There would soon be a huge change in the 29th, Lieutenent Colonel Wilson had to step down due to a lack of time a new battalion commander was appointed. After the previous Lt. Col.'s run of ten years LTC Wheatley had a lot to live up to. He had a good foundation and continued to help the 29th as it's new leader.</p>

										<h2><span class="small">RS2:VIETNAM AND SQUAD</span> GAME CHANGES</h2>
									</div>
									<div class="body">
										<p>All good things come to an end at some point, as our previous games came to be dated it was time for another switch. New suitable games were found that meet our needs entirely and provided a platform for us to excell in. This is how we found our current homes in RS2: Vietnam and the tactical shooter Squad. It enabled modding and had all the core functionality for us to be able to run our drills. Shortly after this switch after we stabilized we shut down Able and Baker companies leaving Charlie company (Arma 3) and the newly created Dog (RS2:Vietnam) and Easy (Squad) companies.</p>
