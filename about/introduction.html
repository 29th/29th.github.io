						<p id="about_section_header">&nbsp; Introduction &nbsp;</p>
						<p id="about_section_text"><b>What is the 29th ID?</b><br>The 29th Infantry Division is a realism unit in the online Modern Conflict game Arma III. Recently we have also started new companies in Rising Storm 2: Vietnam and Squad games. Realism is the conducting of a gaming group as close to real combat as possible.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">By using the menu on the left, you can browse through more information explaining different aspects of Realism and the 29th ID.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">We base our unit off of the US Army during World War II. From there, the rank system, medals and weapons have been based and modified to fit into each game respectively.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">When you enlist, you start as a Private and enter basic training for a week, where you are trained and pounded into place by drill sergeants as they make you "29th Material".</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">We have several servers, as listed on the servers page which can be found on the navbar, where we play publicly and host realism scrimmages.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">If you are looking to enter a new aspect of online gaming, have fun, and learn a lot about the US military system, enlist with the 29th Infantry Division.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="about_realism_small" class="animated fadeIn">
						<p id="about_section_header">&nbsp; What is Realism? &nbsp;</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">The 29th Infantry Division practices a sort of teamwork-oriented style of gameplay, known as "Realism". It is much different from the "death match" style play seen on the public server. It is the portrayal of real tactics, strategies, and conduct through an online 70 player game. When you die in a realism scrimmage, you do not respawn until the end of the round. You must work as a team to keep each other alive. If you are looking for a different gaming atmosphere, community, and experience - Realism may be for you.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text"><b>Set-Up</b><br>In a Realism match, there are many different styles and scenarios. The most common are Attack/Attack and Attack/Defense, meaning both teams attack at the same time, or one team attacks while the other defends an area. Once the terms and weapon allowances are established, your platoon (or team) leader will designate squad leaders and give them assignments. They will delegate the specific responsibilities to each member of their squad and go over the plan. Everyone has an assignment and is vital to the survival of the tea</p>
						<p id="about_section_text"><b>In the Heat of the Battle</b><br>After your team moves out to secure its objective, you encounter the enemy - also trying to secure their objective. The feeling at this point, acknowledging that you only have one life, has been described as "the most adrenaline ever received in a video game." Between providing your teammates suppressive fire to dodging bullets yourself, you hear your squad leader shouting orders to keep you all alive, and the team leader's communication with his squad leaders, revising the plan to ensure victory.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text"><b>Victory conditions</b><br>As there are no respawns in a standard realism scenario, flag capturing is generally disallowed. A victory is obtained by eliminating the enemy force. This is different, of course, with the many other scenarios used by the 29th such as Reinforcements, Attack/Counter-Attack, Isolation, Prisoner Rescue, Escort, Paratroopers (with real parachutes), etc.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="about_training_small" class="animated fadeIn">
						<p id="about_section_header">&nbsp; Our Training System &nbsp;</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">Following Basic Combat Training, newly graduated Privates are assigned to a squad, where they may discuss their Advanced Infantry Training (AIT) options with the Squad Leader. Depending on the slots that are open in the squad, soldiers may request to train with the Rifle, BAR, Machine Gun, Bazooka, etc. and be given personalized training with their AIT weapon.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">Soldiers may qualify for three different Arms Qualification Badges (AQB) for their AIT weapon: The Marksman Badge, the Sharpshooter Badge, and the Expert Badge. Each badge has a unit-wide list of criteria. With a lot of practice, as well as tips from their squad leader or other veteran 29ers, soldiers can meet these criteria and be awarded the badges, which will be proudly displayed on their service coats and qualify them for official battle. In addition, soldiers may qualify for the Expert Infantry Badge, another requirement for official battle, which pertains to combat skills and communication.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">To speed up the process of training and qualifying, the Infantry School holds classes periodically where soldiers in training can receive tips from experts and be tested for the badge criteria. After qualifying high enough, soldiers will have the opportunity to pass on their skills to newer members in training as well, through leadership and the Infantry School.</p>

						<p id="about_section_header">&nbsp; Historical 29th &nbsp;</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">June 6, 1944</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">6:30 AM</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">Normandy, France</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">Omaha Beach</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">The first wave of the Allied invasion of Europe hits France’s northern shores, and are met with unexpectedly harsh resistance.  Maschinengewehr-42s rip the air, sending more than 1200 rounds per minute toward the Allies.  Blasts from German mortars and artillery create a deafening thunder across the sandy battlefield.  And at the spearhead of the invasion of Omaha Beach:  the 29th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">In what is widely considered one of the toughest, and bloodiest, invasions in America history, the 29th ID and their comrades pushed forward to crush the German defenses.  Less than three days after their triumphant victory on Omaha Beach, the 29th Infantry Division was called upon to advance deeper into enemy territory and capture the town of Isigny.  Advancing through the French hedgerows, the 29th ID proceeded to retake multiple key cities throughout Northern France, liberating the country from Nazi tyranny.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">The war took the 29th through four campaigns:  Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, and Central Europe; all of which pushed back the Nazi offensive, and paved the way for the Allied advance into Germany.  During their tours, the 29th was recognized for their brave, valiant efforts by being awarded 40 Distinguished Service Cross, 11 Legion of Merit, 856 Silver Star, 25 Soldier Medal, 5,954 Bronze Star, and 176 Air Medal.  During their campaigns, the unit captured nearly 39,000 Prisoners of War, a key objective in negotiating with enemy states.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">“The Blue and Gray”, as the 29th ID is often referred to, comes from the unit’s seal, or insignia.  A taijitu, or “yin yang”, of half blue and half gray represents the composition of the unit; which is composed of men from both the North (Union Blue) and the South (Confederate Gray).  It represents eternal life, and the relentless drive of the 29th Infantry Division.  The unit’s motivational saying is “Ever Forward”, which coincides with the idea of the insignia:  Never giving up, never surrendering, always ahead.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">The 29th Infantry Division is one of the most recognized units to fight during World War II on the side of the Allied Forces.  Their bravery, tenacity, and brotherhood, is what encompasses the core idea of the United States Military.  A soldier in the 29th Infantry Division is a proud one; always ready to fight, always ready to lead the way.</p>

					<div id="about_history_small" class="animated fadeIn">
						<p id="about_section_header">&nbsp; History of Our Unit &nbsp;</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">The 29th Infantry Division was activated on March 14, 2005 playing in both the The Trenches and Battle Grounds. The reputable 29th Infantry Division that stands before you today participates in the "realism" community of the Red Orchestra Modification, Darkest Hour: Normandy 1944, Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm, Arma 3, Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, and Squad.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">Prior to August of 2008, the 29th Infantry Division was a unit within the Half-Life Modification, Day of Defeat. When the 29th started out in Day of Defeat, there were roughly 17 members, and almost half of them were inactive. Today, the 29th ID has come to be the largest Realism Unit with almost 300 members. Through training and discipline we've gotten to where we stand today. With new members, returning members, and even veteran members from nearly 6 years ago, we continue growing stronger by the day.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">Basic Combat Training, or BCT, is one of the ways we accomplish training new unit members, Cadets, into respectable soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division. Our intricate and well organized office, Lighthouse, takes care of BCT and trains every soldier that enters the unit.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text">Because of Lighthouse and its efforts, our number are constantly growing. There are many other offices and ways to get involved in the unit; here in the 29th we don't simply "get by." Hundreds of individuals have put forth hundreds of hours building the foundation on which this unit stands today, and we are proud to call ourselves soldiers of the Fightin' 29th!</p>

									</div>
									<div class="body">
										<p>Our journey started in 2005 in the game The Trenches and Battle Grouds as a small group setting the very first footprint in our path of history. It was founded by at the time Captain Pak. Later was taken over by Captain Radcliffe.</p>

										<h2><span class="small">MOVEMENT INTO DOD</span> GAME CHANGE</h2>
									</div>
									<div class="body">
										<p>We completely moved to Day of Defeat and closed down the prior two companies. We closed down the company in the prior two games and stuck in one game each time we changed. This is where most of our roots can be traced back too today and here is where major changes took place to put in place the regulations that are still abided by today. These changes were brought on by another Company HQ level change during a transition from Captain Radcliffe to Captain Wilson in late 2015. He would then bring in the one game rule.</p>

										<h2><span class="small">MOVE TO DARKEST HOUR</span> BATTALION LEVEL</h2>
									</div>
									<div class="body">
										<p>After DOD became dated we moved to the next hottest thing striving and alive as ever. We did another game change to darkest hour. We upgraded to Battalion size right away. We went from four platoons and one company into two platoons for two different comapnies each. So instead of just being a company we created a different company. We mainly utalized for for an eastern comapny and western company.</p>

										<h2><span class="small">SPLIT INTO ARMA 3 AND RO2/RS </span> MULTI GAMES</h2>
									</div>
									<div class="body">
										<p>As new games came out that would be adequate for our needs we started to check out our options. We learned that there was a demand for a a realism unit such as ourself in the games Arma 3 and RO2/RS. After the decission was made to break our one game tradition, we swiftly transitioned into creating two new companies for the game, which is where Charlie and Baker were formed. Baker was no longer associated with Darkest Hour. We stayed in DOD and put all the platoons under one comapny thar was called Able. That would leave dog company unattended which left to it being disbanded and ressurected later. We solved the time zone issue by making platoons dedicated to eastern and western personnel.</p>

										<p>There would soon be a huge change in the 29th, Lieutenent Colonel Wilson had to step down due to a lack of time a new battalion commander was appointed. After the previous Lt. Col.'s run of ten years LTC Wheatley had a lot to live up to. He had a good foundation and continued to help the 29th as it's new leader.</p>

									</div>
									<div class="body">
										<p>All good things come to an end at some point, as our previous games came to be dated it was time for another switch. New suitable games were found that meet our needs entirely and provided a platform for us to excell in. This is how we found our current homes in RS2: Vietnam and the tactical shooter Squad. It enabled modding and had all the core functionality for us to be able to run our drills. Shortly after this switch after we stabilized we shut down Able and Baker companies leaving Charlie company (Arma 3) and the newly created Dog (RS2:Vietnam) and Easy (Squad) companies.</p>

						<p id="about_section_header">&nbsp; Q&A &nbsp;</p>
						<p id="about_section_text"><b>Before Enlisting</b></p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: Do I have to use my real name?</b><br>A: Most of us do, but you don't have to; however, we would like for you to pick a realistic last name, as long as it's not already used.<br>e.g. NOT Pvt. Suicidal J3di, instead Frank James is more what we are looking for.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: Do I need to have past gaming/realism experience in order to join the 29th?</b><br>A: No, we welcome players from all skill levels to join the ranks of the 29th. It's more about the attitude and dedication you show. The 29th will take care of training you.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: Does everyone need to go through Basic Combat Training?</b><br>A: Yes, every single member of the unit has gone through BCT - all the way up to the commander of the 29th - and every new member needs to complete it as well.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: What will I learn in BCT?</b><br>AA: The basics about realism gaming, the 29th, and the game you choose:  Darkest Hour, Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2, Arma 3.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: Do I have to use my in-game name and tag all the time when playing DH?</b><br>A: In the 29th servers you must wear your name and tag at all times. Outside of the 29th servers it is not required, but it is recommended, as the 29th tag carries weight and respect.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: How long will it take to get my application processed?</b><br>A: If you fill out all the information asked, as detailed as possible, it will be accepted or denied within roughly 48 hours.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: Can I practice in the Platoon Server when it's empty?</b><br>A: No, you're only allowed on the Platoon Server during the times of BCT.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: Does the 29th use Teamspeak?</b><br>A: Yes, and it is open to the public. You may find the information <a href="http://www.29th.org/forums/index.php?topic=39065.0" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: How do I get my full name as my in-game name? I can't get my name to fit!</b><br>A: Drop down the console, type this command: set input KEY setname Pvt. Lastname [29th 301]<br>Replace KEY with any key that you wish to bind this command to, replace your name and TP number accordingly. Hit "enter" key, and close console. When You enter the server, hit that binded key, and you will have your full in-game name. For details on this, see this <a href="http://29th.org/dh/index.php?title=Name_Changing" target="_blank">page</a>.</p>

						<p id="about_section_text"><b>During BCT</b></p>
						<p id="about_section_text">Remember to read the <a href="http://www.29th.org/wiki/index.php?title=FM_21-20_%22Cadet%27s_Handbook%22" target="_blank">Cadet Handbook</a> during BCT!</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: Why can't I connect to the Platoon Server? I've been sitting in a black screen for over 15 mins now and can't attend my first day of BCT!</b><br>A: This is due to a name bug in the game. Disconnect from the black screen by pressing Esc or F10, change your in-game name to something short like "Pvt." and reconnect. Still, if you can't connect, contact someone online/in-game from your BCT's steamgroup.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: What is a steamgroup?</b><br>A: A steamgroup is a community in Steam. Anyone can create one of their own to stay in touch with friends, clanmates, people with the same interests etc. It has features like calendar, announcements, chat room etc.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: Where can I find my BCT's steamgroup and what is the purpose of it?</b><br>A: The direct link can be found from your enlistment post after a liaison's reply. You'll get notifications about when your BCT starts, you can easily contact your BCT buddies, liaisons, ask for help, anything!</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: Where can I find the server password and ip?</b><br>A: All that information can be found at your enlistment post after a liaison has replied there.</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: If I am the only player from the 29th on our company server, what do I do when someone breaks the rules?</b><br>A: Until you graduate, it is not your duty to enforce 29th rules on our servers. You can report troublemakers to your Enlistment Liaison by PM (Private Message) on the forums (nickname, server, time, description of problem).</p>
						<p id="about_section_text_indented"><b>Q: Can I just use any class available in DH, while being in the 29th?</b><br>A: As the rifle is the most common and most effective weapon in the game, all of our incoming soldiers learn its ins-and-outs. After graduating BCT, soldiers are given the opportunity to choose an AIT (Advanced Infantry Training) class such as the Machine Gun, the BAR, the Rifle, the Bazooka, etc. That said, you are restricted to the rifles (and the grenades, etc. that come with the rifle classes) at all times during BCT and until you are told otherwise by your squad leader.<br><i>Note: this only counts for the 29th servers. On any other server you are allowed to pick any class you want - but as many have noticed, the rifle isn't that bad a choice of weapon after all.</i></p>
