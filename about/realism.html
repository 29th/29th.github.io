				<p id="about_section_header">&nbsp; What is Realism? &nbsp;</p>
				<p id="about_section_text">To those not in the know, Realism (particularly within the 29th) is the community practice of teamwork-oriented gameplay mixed with a desire to strive towards emulation of historical military traditions. Spawning from an uptick of more realistic (for the time) shooters back at the turn of the millenium, realism functions radically different from the "death match" style of play more regularly seen in games. In Realism style play, an individual soldier's life matters and the ability to sway the game isn't based on the highest K/D but which team operates the most effectively together in a tactic-necessitating scenario. In a game where dead men don't speak and there is no respawn timer waiting for you after death to herald your return, realism finds its place. If this intense style of gameplay experience has you biting at the bit, realism may well be for you.</p>
				<p id="about_section_text"><b>Preparation</b><br>Unlike an ordinary pub session in any server of your choice, Realism must be prepared for. Rather than rushing B when the timer comes up at the start of a map, realism requires organizers to put together complex scenarios with potentially multiple objectives and assets all being intertwined. Following this period of preparation, individual units (such as squads and platoons) must prepare plans and tactics to face up to the coming storm. As such, team leaders will develop plans of attack and disseminate them to command elements lower down on the chain of command. Certain AITs will be made available, assets like armored vehicles will be doled out, and positions will be taken in preparation for the match ahead. In this style of play even a rifleman has a vital part to play in the grand strategy about to commence. In realism, there is no room for useless team members.</p>
				<p id="about_section_text"><b>Battle Commences</b><br>When LIVE is called and the round begins, firefights can immediately break out. Whether encountered directly outside of your starting point or after the convoy entered the area of operation, bombs and bullets will start flying eventually. This is when the real heat of realism kicks in; remember, each soldiers has one life and dead men tell no tales. With adrenaline pumping through their veins, squads will push up to engage with the enemy or dig into their defensive positions. It is during this flash of early engagements where battles can be decided as team leaders move elements to respond to each new arriving threat and on the ground each soldier reacts to the ever changing tides of the fighting. With solid lines of communication and teamwork, however, just about any threat can be overcome.</p>
				<p id="about_section_text"><b>Objective Secured</b><br>As the round goes on one can expect to make a beeline for their squad's intended objective. Whether it be the elimination or retrieval of a VIP, the destruction of an enemy armored asset, or the removal of all OpFor in the area of operation, that objective MUST be secured. Team leadership and squad leadership will work in concert, directing what remains of their initial attacks and changing up their plans on the fly to complete these objectives. It is here when the ground pounders truly shine as no plan survives contact with the enemy and the actions of a single rifleman can single handedly snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.</p>
